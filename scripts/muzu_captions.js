      intro0: "Hi there! My name is Muzu. And this here is my brain",
      intro1:
        "In my brain and your brain, there are millions of these things called neurons!",
      intro2: "Neurons are very social. They like to connect with each other.",
      intro3: "and these connections are called synapses.",

      l2p1: "Oh no! It looks like these neurons are too far apart!",
      l2p2: "We have to make a path between these two neurons so that I can learn math.",
      l2p3: "Hmm... what should we do?",
      l2p4: "Maybe we can add some new neurons!",
      l2p5: "Try clicking and dragging a blue neuron from the toolbar on top into my brain.",
      // wait until user clicks and drags excitatory neuron
      l2p6: "Way to go! You just added a new excitatory neuron!",
      l2p7: "Now, remember how we learned to create new neural connections last time?",
      l2p8: "Go ahead and connect this new neuron to the starting neuron on the left!",
      l2p9: "I'll be here doing some math problems.",
      // wait until user adds a connection
      l2p10: "Wow! My brain just created a new connection while I was learning!",
      l2p11: "Now, can you help me create a path all the way from start to finish?",
      l2end: "Whoa! I learned something new! Thanks for helping me make my brain stronger."
