      intro0: "Hi there! My name is Muzu. And this here is my brain.",
      intro1:
        "In my brain and your brain, there are millions of these things called neurons!",
      intro2: "They like to connect with each other.",
      intro3: "and these connections are called synapses.",
      intro4:
        "Neurons are very social. They like to send signals to each other.",
      intro5: "Go ahead and click on a neuron to fire it.",
      //listener: when they click on a neuron
      intro6:
        "Watch as it sends signals to other neurons through its synapses!",
      intro7:
        "As new synapses form in our brains, that’s when we can learn new things!",
      intro8: "But the neurons only fire, and the synapses can only grow...",
      intro9: "when I’m working hard learning something.",
      intro10: "Like this!",
      intro11: "For example, let’s venture into the math portion of my brain.",

      // LEVEL 1: Hebbian learning ///////

      level1_0:
        "Right now, there are no connections because I haven’t practiced math in a LONG time.",
      level1_1:
        "But as I start practicing, new connections can start forming in my brain!",
      level1_2: "Can you help me rewire my brain while I work? Try it out!",
      level1_3:
        "To make a connection, click on a neuron, then click on the neuron you want it to form a synapse with.",
      level1_4:
        "Wow! While I was working, my brain was making new connections!",
      level1_5: "I just learned a new math problem!",
      // level1_6: "Thanks for helping me rewire my brain!",
      level1_7:
        "Now that you know how to connect two neurons, go ahead and click on the next level!",

      /////////////
      // LEVEL 2: Dragging on new neurons //
      /////////////
      l2p1: "Oh no! It looks like these neurons are too far apart!",
      l2p2:
        "We have to make a path between these two neurons so that I can learn math.",
      l2p3: "Hmm... what should we do?",
      l2p4: "Maybe we can add some new neurons!",
      l2p5:
        "Try clicking and dragging a blue neuron from the toolbar on top into my brain.",
      // wait until user clicks and drags excitatory neuron
      l2p6: "Way to go! You just added a new excitatory neuron!",
      l2p7:
        "Now, remember how we learned to create new neural connections last time?",
      l2p8:
        "Go ahead and connect this new neuron to the starting neuron on the left!",
      l2p9: "I'll be here doing some math problems.",
      // wait until user adds a connection
      l2p10:
        "Wow! My brain just created a new connection while I was learning!",
      l2p11:
        "Now, can you help me create a path all the way from start to finish?",
      l2p12:
        "Whoa! While I was working on math, my brain was growing stronger!",
      l2end: "Thanks for your help! Go ahead and click on the next level.",

      l3p1: "Have you ever wondered why you forget how to do things...",
      l3p2: "if you don’t practice them for a while?",
      //neurons appear
      l3p3: "Well, it all has to do with these neurons in your brain!",
      l3p4:
        "If two neuron’s don’t send signals to each other for a long time...",
      //synapses disappear
      l3p5: "Their synapses disappear!",
      l3p6: "This is called the “use it or lose it” principle",
      l3p7: "And that’s why it’s so important to keep practicing something...",
      l3p8: "So that you can keep those synapses strong!",
      l3p9:
        "When I’m not practicing math, the synapses in the math portion of my brain...",
      l3p10: "will weaken a little (by getting thinner)...",
      l3p11: "every time the bar at the top reaches the end.",
      //muzu practicing, and neurons fire
      l3p12: "But if I keep practicing... ",
      l3p13: "My neurons will fire, and my synapses will grow and stay strong!",
      //level 3 set up
      l3p14: "Let's give it a try as I do some math!",
      l3p15: "While I'm working, I'll get discouraged sometimes and stop",
      l3p16:
        "When that happens, my neurons won't fire, and I'll start forgetting!",
      l3p17: "You'll have encourage me to start working again.",
      l3p18: "So that I can continue learning!",

      l4p1: "So far, we’ve only been working with neurons...",
      l4p2: "that send signals to make other neurons fire.",
      //neurons appear
      l4p3: "These are called excitatory neurons.",
      l4p4: "But what about neurons that cause other neurons to NOT fire?",
      //synapses disappear
      l4p5: "These are called inhibitory neurons.",
      l4p6:
        "On the left, the excitatory neuron makes its neighbor's firing bar go up.",
      l4p7:
        "But on the right, the inhibitory neuron makes its neighbors firing bar go down.",
      l4p8: "As I work on my next math problem, ...",
      l4p9: "you’ll have to help me learn by making the last neuron fire...",
      l4p10: "Even when it has inhibitory neurons connected to it!",
      l4p11:
        "Make sure that every neuron is connected to the starting neuron, though!"
