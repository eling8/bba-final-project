      intro0: "Hi there! My name is Muzu. And this here is my brain",
      intro1:
        "In my brain and your brain, there are millions of these things called neurons!",
      intro2: "Neurons are very social. They like to connect with each other.",
      intro3: "and these connections are called synapses.",
      intro4:
        "As new synapses form in our brains, that’s when we can learn new things!",
      intro5:
        "But the synapses can only grow when I’m working hard learning something.",
      intro6: "For example, let’s venture into the math portion of my brain.",

      level1_0:
        "Right now, there are no connections because I haven’t practiced math in a long time.",
      level1_1:
        "But as I start practicing, new connections can start forming in my brain!",
      level1_2:
        "To make a connection, click on a neuron, then click on the neuron you want it to form a synapse with.",
      level1_3:
        "Wow! While I was working, my brain was making new connections!",
      level1_4: "I just learned how to do my first math problem!",
      level1_5: "Thanks for helping me rewire my brain!",

      l2p1: "Oh no! It looks like these neurons are too far apart!",
      l2p2:
        "We have to make a path between these two neurons so that I can learn math.",
      l2p3: "Hmm... what should we do?",
      l2p4: "Maybe we can add some new neurons!",
      l2p5:
        "Try clicking and dragging a blue neuron from the toolbar on top into my brain.",
      // wait until user clicks and drags excitatory neuron
      l2p6: "Way to go! You just added a new excitatory neuron!",
      l2p7:
        "Now, remember how we learned to create new neural connections last time?",
      l2p8:
        "Go ahead and connect this new neuron to the starting neuron on the left!",
      l2p9: "I'll be here doing some math problems.",
      // wait until user adds a connection
      l2p10:
        "Wow! My brain just created a new connection while I was learning!",
      l2p11:
        "Now, can you help me create a path all the way from start to finish?",
      l2p12:
        "Whoa! While I was working on math, my brain was making new connections!",
      l2pend:
        "I learned something new! Thanks for helping me make my brain stronger."
